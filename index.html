                                    <p>Dear Mrs. Jesus Christ,</p>

<p>What will this Sunday hold for the Bride of Jesus Christ? What all will the Holy Spirit reveal to us? <u>Perfect Realization</u>. We will now fully understand by Revelation, antitype contrasted with type and substance with shadow. Jesus is the true Bread of Life. He is the whole of It. He is One God. He is Hebrews 13:8. He is the I AM.</p>

<p>Christ, by appearing in the flesh and shedding His own Blood, has put away our sins once and for all by the offering of Himself; therefore He has now made us PERFECT. His very life is in us. His Blood has cleansed us.  His Spirit fills us. His stripes have ALREADY healed us.</p>

<p>His Word is in our heart and mouth. It’s Christ in our lives and nothing else, as everything in our lives fade away into insignificance, besides Him and His Word.</p>

<p>Our heart will be filled with joy as He tells us that by His Divine decree, He knew exactly who would be His Bride. How He chose us. He called us. He died for us. He paid the price for us and we belong to Him, and Him alone.  He speaks, and we obey, for it is our delight. We are His sole property and He has no other one but US. He is our King of kings and we are His kingdom. We are His eternal possession.</p>

<p>He will strengthen us and illuminate us by His Voice Word. He will clearly explain and reveal that He is the Door of the sheep. He is both Alpha and Omega. He is Father, He is the Son, and He is the Holy Spirit. He is One, and we are One with Him and in Him.</p>

<p>He will teach us patience, as He did Abraham, by explaining how we must patiently wait and endure if we wish to obtain any promise.</p>

<p>He will clearly show us the very day that we’re living in. How the ecumenical move will become so strong <u>politically</u>, and place pressure up on the <u>government</u> for all to join her through adherence to principles enacted into law, so that no people will be recognized as churches unless direct or indirect domination of their council.</p>

<p>He will reveal how many will go along, thinking they are serving God in the framework of the organization. But He tells us, “Have no fear, for the Bride will not be deceived, we will stay with His Word, His Voice.”</p>

<p>How encouraging it will be to hear Him tells us: “Hold fast, persevere. Never give up, but put on the whole armor of God, every weapon, every gift I have given you is at our disposal. Don’t never be discouraged sweetheart, just keep looking ahead with joy because you are going to be crowned by Me, your King of kings and Lord of Lords, your Husband.”</p>

<p>You are My true church; the very temple of God by My Holy Ghost that is living within you. You will become pillars in the new temple; the very foundation that will hold up the superstructure. I will place you as overcomers with the apostles and the prophets, for I have given you a Revelation of My Word, of Myself.</p>

<p>He will clearly reveal to us that our names were written in His Lamb’s Book Of Life before the foundation of the world. We will therefore be before His throne day and night to serve Him in His temple. We are the special care of the Lord; we are His Bride.</p>

<p>We will have a new name by taking on His name. It will be the name that is given unto us when He takes us to Himself. We will be His Mrs. Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>The new Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven, a Bride adorned for her Husband. There will be no more death, sorrow, nor crying.  Neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away. All of God’s wonderful promises will be fulfilled. The change will be completed.  The Lamb and His Bride will forever be settled in all the perfections of God.</p>

<p>Dear Mrs. Jesus Christ, DREAM ABOUT IT. It will be more wonderful than you could ever imagine.</p>

<p>I invite everyone to come join us this Sunday at 12:00 P.M., Jeffersonville time, as our Husband, Jesus Christ, speaks through His mighty seventh angel messenger and tells us all these things.</p>

<p>Bro. Joseph Branham</p>

<p>We know, without a shadow of a single doubt, we are in God’s perfect Will by staying with His Word; listening to His Voice by way of His mighty seventh angel messenger.</p>

<p>The messenger He chose for our day is William Marrion Branham. He is God’s lamp to the world, reflecting God’s Light. He is calling out His chosen Pure Word Bride by His angel.</p>

<p>By careful study of His Word, He has revealed to us by His Holy Spirit that William Marrion Branham is the angel He chose to give His Revelation and Ministry to for our day. We see His angel, OUR STAR, in His right hand as He is granting him His power to reveal His Word and call out His Bride.</p>

<p>He has given us the full Revelation of Himself. The Holy Spirit identifying Himself to us through the life of His seventh angel messenger; the angel He chose to be His eyes for our day.</p>

<p>How our hearts burn within us as He tells us with each Message that it is His purpose to bring us forth unto Himself; that we are His Word Bride.</p>

<p>He loves to tell us over and over how He chose us before the foundation of the world IN HIM. How we were foreknown and beloved by Him.</p>

<p>How we love to hear Him speak and tell us we were redeemed by His Blood and can NEVER come into condemnation. We can never be in the judgment, because sin cannot be imputed unto us.</p>

<p>How we will set with Him as He takes His earthly throne of David, and we rule with Him; just like He did in heaven, with power and authority over all the earth. The test and trials of this life will seem like nothing then.</p>

<p>But He has also warned us how careful we must be. That throughout the ages the two vines grew side by side. How the enemy has always been so close; so deceiving. Even Judas was chosen of God, and instructed in truth. He shared knowledge of the mysteries. He had a ministry of power granted unto him and he healed the sick and cast out devils in Jesus’ Name. But he couldn’t go all the way.</p>

<p>You can’t go along with just part of the Word, you have to take ALL the Word. There are people who seem involved in the things of God almost one hundred percent, but they are not.</p>

<p>He said it wasn’t enough that He has associated Himself with the whole church, or even with the fivefold ministry of Ephesians four. He warned us that in each age the church goes astray, and it is not just the laity but the clergy group — shepherds are wrong as well as sheep.</p>

<p>So by the determined counsel of His own will, He brought Himself on the scene in our age as the Chief Shepherd in the ministry of His seventh angel messenger to lead His people back to the truth and the abundant power of that truth.</p>

<div class="BBquoteText">
<p>He is in His messenger and he who would have the fulness of God would follow the messenger as the messenger is a follower of the Lord by His Word.</p>
</div>

<p>I want to have the fullness of God and follow His messenger. Thus, for us, the Branham Tabernacle, the only way to follow the messenger as he follows the Lord by His Word, is to <strong>PRESS PLAY</strong> and hear the Pure Voice of God speak to us the words of infallibility.</p>

<p>We don’t have to guess or check what we are hearing, we just have to Press Play and believe every Word we are hearing.</p>

<p>I heard Brother Branham say the following quote early one morning on the Voice radio. When I heard It, it came on my heart that this is exactly how I / we feel about saying:</p>

<p>WE JUST PRESS PLAY AND HEAR THE TAPES.</p>

<p>It sounded like a statement of our Faith to me.</p>

<div class="BBquoteText">
<p>That’s the reason I believe in this Message, is because It comes from the Word of God. And anything outside the Word of God, I don’t believe it. <u>It could be so</u>, <strong>but still I’ll just stay with what God said, and then be sure that I’m right.</strong> Now, <u>God can do what He wants to. He’s God.</u> <strong>But as long as I stay with His Word, then I know that’s all right. I believe that.</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Glory, he said it so PERFECT.  All other ministries <u>could be</u>, because God can do what He wants to, with who He wants to, He’s God. <strong>But as long as I stay with His Word, His Voice, the Tapes, <u>then I know that’s all right. I believe that.</u></strong></p>

<p>I know many read my letters and misunderstand what I say and what I believe to be the Will of the Lord for our church. May I humbly say once again as the prophet said: “These letters are meant for my church only. The ones that desire to call the Branham Tabernacle their church. The ones that WANT TO BE IDENTIFIED AND CALLED TAPE PEOPLE”.</p>

<p>If you disagree with what I say and believe, that is 100% fine my brothers and sisters. My letters are not meant for you or against you or your churches. Your church is sovereign and you must do as you feel led to do, but according to the Word, so is ours, and this is what we believe is God’s provided way for us.</p>

<p>All are always welcome to unite with us each Sunday at 12:00 P.M., Jeffersonville time. This week, God’s Star for our age, William Marrion Branham, will be bringing us the Message, <em>60-1209 The Sardisean Church Age</em>.</p>

                                    <p>Dear Illuminated Bride,</p>

<p>How the Lord is revealing to us that throughout all the ages there has always been a very small group that stayed with His Word. They did not fall into the deceiving trap of the enemy, but remained true and faithful to the Word for their day.</p>

<p>But there has never been a time, or a group of people, that the Lord has been prouder of, or had more confidence in, than us. We are His Elect Lady Bride that will not, and even more important, <u>CANNOT</u>, be deceived; for we hear the Shepherd’s Voice and follow Him.</p>

<p>He is showing us that throughout all the ages there has been two groups of people, both proclaiming their revelation from God and their relationship to God. But He told us, the Lord knoweth them that are His. He tracks down our thoughts.  He knows what is in our hearts. He sees our works by staying with the prophet and His Word, which are a <u>definite manifestation of what lies within us</u>. Our motives, our purposes is known unto Him as He watches our every action.</p>

<p>He tells us that all the promises that He gave to each age, are OURS. He sees us who keeps doing His works faithfully until the end. He has GIVEN US power over nations.  He tells us we are strong, capable, unbending rulers who can cope so <u>powerfully with any situation</u>. <strong>Even the most desperate enemy will be broken if need be.</strong> Our demonstration of rule by His power will be like unto the very Son’s. GLORY!!</p>

<p>We have experienced the depth of God in our life. It is a personal experience of the Spirit of God indwelling in us. Our minds are illuminated by the wisdom and knowledge of God through His Word.</p>

<p>We go wherever the Bridegroom is. We will never be left by Him. We will never leave His side. We will share the throne with Him. We will be crowned with His glory and honor.</p>

<p>He has revealed to us how deceiving the enemy has been in each age and how important it is to STAY WITH HIS ORIGINAL WORD. Not one Word can be changed. Each age added to and took away from, placing their own interpretation to the original Word; and are eternally lost by doing so.</p>

<p>In the Thyatirean Church Age, that deceiving spirit spoke through the pope of Rome and changed His Word. He made it “one mediator between God and man (not men).” So now he mediates between the mediator and men. Thus, the whole program of God was altered; not by changing a word, but by changing ONE LETTER. Satan had changed an “E” to an “A”.</p>

<p>Every Word will be judged by His Original Word spoken on the tapes. Therefore, His Bride MUST stay with the tapes. While the enemy tries to discourage the people by giving them a different program, a different idea, a different letter, the Bride will STAY WITH THE ORIGINAL WORD.</p>

<p>In each age Jesus identifies Himself with the messenger of that age. They receive from Him the revelation on the Word for their age. <u>This Word revelation brings the elect of God out of the world and into full union with Jesus Christ.</u></p>

<p>He has called and ordained many men to be a blessing to the church, but He ONLY has but ONE MESSENGER that He called to LEAD His church by His Holy Spirit. There is ONE VOICE with Thus Saith The Lord. There is ONE VOICE He said He would judge us by. There is ONE VOICE His Bride is placing their eternal destination on. THAT VOICE IS THE VOICE OF GOD ON THE TAPES.</p>

<p>Bride, God’s will for us is Perfection, and in His sight, we ARE PERFECT.  And that perfection is patience, waiting on God...<u>and waiting for God</u>. He tells us it is the process of our character development. We may have many tests, trials and tribulations, but your faithfulness to His Word is working patience in us that we may be perfect and entire, lacking nothing.</p>

<p>We will never forget FAITH cometh by hearing, hearing the Word, and the Word comes to the prophet.</p>

<p>Come and experience the greatest joy of your life as you sit together with us in Heavenly places as we hear the Voice of God bring us the Word on: <em>The Thyatirean Church Age 60-1208</em>, this Sunday at 12:00 P.M., Jeffersonville time.</p>
