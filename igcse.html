                  The Department

The Department is staffed by five dedicated teachers, all of whom bring their own individual skills and interests together to ensure that the subject is taught effectively.

CHECKPOINT ENGLISH – D & C BLOCK

The junior classes are streamed into 4 sets based on the Access Reading and Schonell Spelling Tests taken in their first week at high school.

In D Block, which is their first year in high school, we consolidate and extend the girls’ knowledge about language; we seek to develop and refine their literacy skills and to introduce them to the study of Literature by analysing a text, of the teacher’s choice and appropriate for the set.

The department works to develop the pupil’s accuracy in spelling and vocabulary, and spend a great amount of time on advanced grammar. The skills taught in D Block provide a foundation for the IGCSE syllabus. In addition, the girls are encouraged to develop their skills in listening and speaking in activities such as debating, class presentations and small-group discussions. The girls are encouraged to write creatively, and whilst doing so implement the grammar and vocabulary learnt with each piece of work. As they grow in confidence, they are encouraged to enter the National Allied Arts Literary Competition in the Trinity Term, and can enter their work in to the Standard Cover to Cover Essay Writing Competition.

In C Block, the girls are taught how to write in a range of styles appropriate for a range of audiences – from persuasive to analytical writing. Once again, the skills they have been taught in D Block are tested with each writing assignment. Shakespeare is introduced half way through the year, so that they have a sound understanding of the author and the way in which he writes. This is to provide them with a foundation for the IGCSE English Literature syllabus.

IGCSE – B & A BLOCK

The B Block classes are set according to the year end results at C Block. All of the classes prepare the girls to earn two qualifications – IGCSE English Language and English Literature.

The English Language syllabus extends upon their writing skills for a range of purposes and a variety of forms – including, but not limited to – summary writing, analysis and persuasion. There is opportunity to write creatively, therefore, they are encouraged to expand on their vocabulary, perfect their use of grammatical structures and use of imagery by reading as widely as possible as this expands on their sphere of experiences.

The IGCSE English Literature syllabus complements the English Language syllabus, by providing a variety of texts which the girls study. The syllabus covers a range of genres and these have to be read and analysed by the pupil – drama, prose and poetry. Through our pupil-centred approach, pupils learn to develop independent opinions on texts, identify themes and examine the effectiveness of linguistic devices. An important skill learnt through literature is an appreciation of different cultures and beliefs, understanding and accepting different characters, and they learn to appreciate who and what they are through reading about people and situations that are far worse than their own.

                The Department

Chemistry is taught in lab 2 and 3 respectively. Two teachers are involved in the teaching of Chemistry at Peterhouse. The teachers are very dedicated to their work, and are always willing to assist pupils to increase their understanding of the concepts studied. The department is well equipped with chemicals, apparatus, excellent large wall periodic table for each class and textbooks which are relevant to their syllabus and this enhances the learning of this subject.

Teaching

There are eight lessons per cycle, one double and six single lessons. Chemistry is a practical subject and experiments are central to the teaching of the subject. These are done as demonstrations, or by the pupils themselves working individually or in a small group. At the end of the two years, our pupils sit for IGCSE Chemistry (0620).

At the end of the two years, the candidates should have the following attributes:

A sufficient understanding and knowledge of Chemistry to become confident citizens in a technologically changing world, able to make informed decisions in scientific matters.
They can recognise the usefulness and limitations of the scientific approach.
Show concern for accuracy, precision and integrity in everything they do.
Display an interest in environmental issues and be willing to voluntarily engage in activities aimed at protecting it.

              The Department

The department has two full time members of staff who have years of experience in teaching the subject. There are two IT Laboratories and one technical staff who is responsible for maintenance and technical support. The IT labs are equipped with state of the art computer equipment and full broadband internet access. They both have overhead projectors and white boards. Internet access is closely monitored using classroom management software, firewalls and a reliable hotspot server.

Teaching

At D and C block (form 1 and 2), Information Technology (IT) is taught to all pupils. IT is now part of the educational experience of children in most parts of the world. Taught as a subject in its own right, as well as being embedded within the curriculum, IT is increasingly regarded as a new ‘literacy’, alongside reading, writing and numeracy. IT is designed to introduce learners to the key ICT applications they need to use, in order to acquire that literacy and to understand the impact of technology on our daily lives. The syllabus that we are offering provides a framework in which ICT competence and practical skills can be developed within an environment that is appropriate for the age of the learners.

 

At B and A (form 3and 4), IGCSE Information Communication Technology (ICT) is offered as an optional subject. The ICT syllabus encourages learners to develop lifelong skills, which will be useful to them in their work across the curriculum and prepare them for future employment. They will develop understanding of the implications of technology in society, including social, economic and ethical uses and awareness of the ways ICT can help in home, learning and work environments.

The syllabus combines theoretical and practical studies focusing on the ability to use common software applications to solve problems, including word processors, spreadsheets, databases, interactive presentation software, web browsers and website design. Learners analyse, design, implement, test and evaluate ICT systems, ensuring that they are fit for purpose.

Pupils are allowed to access educational websites for learning purposes and download any valuable materials. Personal printing is allowed and pupils are charged to their accounts. Ownership of a laptop is highly recommended to enable students to develop practical skills in their spare time and during the holidays.

                The Department

Junior science has four teachers and two efficient technicians to support the practical side of our teaching. The four teachers also teach other science subjects as follows two teach Biology, one teaches Biology and Maths and one teaches Chemistry and Physics. These teachers are all dedicated and enthusiastic about their subject, and they encourage girls to develop an interest in the subject and to apply it around them and in the wider world.

We have three well-resourced labs to give learners a solid grounding in science skills.

Teaching

D Block has 9 periods in a cycle, one double and two singles and a similar set up in C Block. The course is dedicated to the acquisition and nurturing of lifelong science skills such as observation, measurement, recording of results ,either in table form or drawing, processing of results in the form of graphs, analysis of results, making deductions from results, evaluating methods used and making conclusions which are informed by evidence. Through these experiences, our girls develop knowledge and understanding of basic scientific concepts and principles as well as the ability to handle information and solve problems. Pupils develop attitudes relevant to the study of science such as accuracy, inventiveness, inquiry and objectivity. Experiences also promote awareness on the benefits and detrimental effects of science.

              The Department

The Geography Department has two full time teachers, plus two who also spend part of their time teaching in other departments. We have a suite of two dedicated classrooms. The teachers have access to data projectors. The staff is all enthusiastic about their subject, and we encourage girls to develop an interest in the Natural and Built environments around them and in the wider world.

Teaching

In D Block there are five lessons per cycle, and in C Block there are five lessons, all taken as singles rather than double lessons. Geography is a content subject, as well as a practical, so we try to keep the girls interested by making their lessons as varied as possible.

Over the two years our pupils learn about the Geography of their own country, both the Physical and the Human aspects. We also begin to look regionally and globally, by looking at aspects of the Geography. A lot of basic concepts are introduced at this level, including weather and climate (making use of our weather station), landforms, population and settlement dynamics.

 

In addition to the purely factual knowledge, Geography is a subject that teaches skills. Map reading is a skill that girls learn in their second year at Peterhouse Girls, and then build on as they move up the school.

Field-work is also important, whether it is going out to draw a map of a part of the school, recording and observing elements of weather, looking at settlement patterns and visiting the Weather station. Tours to other countries are also organised as exposer and to market the subject to Junior forms like this year to Italy.

By the time they reach the end of C Block, girls have acquired a good working knowledge of the world around them, and are well equipped to take the subject further up the school curriculum.

Michaelmas Term – Human Geography and introduction of the structure of the Earth

GEOGRAPHY AT IGCSE LEVEL

Teaching

In B Block there are eight lessons per two week cycle, taken as two double and four single lessons. Geography is a content subject, as well as a practical, so we try to keep the girls interested by making their lessons as varied as possible and often practical or fieldwork can be done in the double lessons and teaches them some useful examination techniques by practising using the actual Cambridge Past Examination Papers. Visits to Gosho Park are organised as part of their practical and tours to other countries as exposer to the real world will be organised. At the end of two years, our pupils sit for IGCSE Geography (0460).

Successful Cambridge IGCSE Geography candidates develop lifelong skills, including:

An understanding of the impacts which both physical and human geography can have and the processes which affect their development;
A sense of place and an understanding of relative location on a local, regional and global scale;
The ability to use and understand geographical data and information;
An understanding of how communities and cultures around the world and how they are affected and constrained by different environments.
At the end of the two year course, our pupils are well equipped to study the subject at A level, but if they choose not to, then they would have acquired skills and knowledge that will be helpful to them for many years to come as they try to solve some of the problems the world is facing today such as food and water shortages, climate change and natural disasters.

              The Department

The Biology department is comprised of five experienced, passionate and dedicated teachers. Three of whom are full time Science teachers. We have three laboratories, two preparatory rooms and one well stocked storeroom. Teachers have access to data projectors in each of the laboratories and the department is well equipped with the recommended textbooks. Practical work is at the centre of instruction and learning. The subject is very popular and offered to all girls in B block and we are proud to see a sizeable number of these girls achieving success at IGCSE.

Teaching

There are eight periods per cycle comprising one doubles and seven singles for extended Biology. Doubles in the cycle are devoted practical tests. We also offer Core Biology to the challenged girls. The girls in the Core Biology have a total of twelve periods per cycle, four of them are extra Biology lessons.To give the requisite grounding in the scientific method, girls work through a practical handbook which gives them opportunities to develop lifelong skills of observation, measurement, recording, analysis, deduction and evaluation. We also encourage learners to devise and plan investigations, drawing on their knowledge and understanding, analyse and interpret data to draw conclusions. Learners get to investigate the way things work and we hope the knowledge gained will be of benefit to mankind.

Interaction with the content enables our learners to acquire knowledge and develop positive attitudes to the environment and an understanding that we can make the best out of our environment without damaging it. Some of our themes use Biology to promote healthy living. We teach our girls the internationally acclaimed Cambridge IGCSE status. This enables them to earn internationally recognised qualifications that will help them prepare for A level Biology or life after school
