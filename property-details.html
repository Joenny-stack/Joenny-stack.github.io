                                    <p>Dear Spirit-Filled Bride,</p>

<p>There is only one group of people; a very special group of people, who are able to hear what the Spirit is saying in this last age. It is a special group that has received the Revelation for this age. That group is of God. The group that cannot hear, is not of God.</p>

<p>The group that can, and does hear what the Spirit is saying, receives the True Revelation. We are the ones who have the Spirit of God. We are the ones that are born of God and baptized with the Holy Ghost. We are His Spirit-Filled Bride that has received the Revelation for our age.</p>

<p>What does it mean for us to Press Play? REVELATION!  It is hearing, receiving and staying with God’s provided Way for today. The very Voice of God speaking lip to ear to His Bride. It is the Holy Spirit speaking to our hearts and souls.</p>

<p>We know God uses men anointed with His Spirit to speak, but there is no other place to hear <em>Thus Saith The Lord</em> except by Pressing Play and hearing the VOICE of His seventh angel, William Marrion Branham. It is the only Voice vindicated by the Holy Spirit Himself. He is God’s Voice, God’s prophet, God’s pastor, to us, and to the world.</p>

<p>When he speaks, we say AMEN to every Word; for it is God Himself speaking to us. His Word is the only Word that needs no interpretation. It is God using his voice to speak to His Bride.</p>

<p>It is God Himself telling us, “My little ones, you have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you. Before there was a speck of stardust; before I was even known to you as your God, I knew you. You were in My Mind, existing in My eternal Thoughts. You are My literal Spoken Word Seed Bride.</p>

<p>Although you were in My eternal Thoughts, I did not express you until My designated and decreed season. For I knew YOU would be My special group that would stay with My Word. All others have failed, but I knew you would not.</p>

<p>I know that you are persecuted and made fun of because you have stayed with My prophet, but you are My True Vine that has not deviated from My Word, but has stayed true and faithful to My prophet who speaks My Words.</p>

<p>There are many others that have been faithfully taught, but they don’t always learn how necessary it is to speak only what I have spoken through My messenger.”</p>

<div class="BBquoteText">
<p>How careful we must be to hear ONE voice, for the Spirit has but one voice which is the voice of God.</p>

<p>Oh, how important it is to hear the voice of God by way of His messengers, and then say what has been given them to say to the churches.</p>
</div>

<p>“My Word has always come to My prophet, but in this day, I had My Voice recorded so there would be NO MISTAKES what I said to the Bride. There is only one plumb line, only one rod, and that is the WORD which I spoke through My angel. As in every age, My prophet is the Word for the day.”</p>

<p>The Tapes, His Voice, is a love letter to us. While the enemy constantly beats us down through our trials and tribulations and hardships, He sent His mighty angel to tell us that it is nothing but God’s elective love to us, proving to us that He has chosen us as we will not move.</p>

<p>His great purpose is after we have suffered for a while, He would make us perfect, establish and strengthen us. He told us that even our Lord Jesus was perfected by His suffering.  What a blessing He has left for us. For by our suffering, He would bring us into perfection also.</p>

<p>He is character-building us through our trials and tribulations. For our character is not made without suffering. Thus, our suffering is a VICTORY to us, and not a gift.</p>

<p>How can we prove our love to Him?</p>

<p style="padding-left:8%;">•	By believing what He says.<br>
•	Staying with His Word.<br>
•	Conducting ourselves with joy through our trials and tribulations, that He, in His great wisdom, allows to come to pass.</p>

<p>How He lifts our spirit by hearing His Word. His Voice comforts our soul. When we Press Play and hear Him speak, all our burdens are lifted. We can’t even begin to imagine what treasures have been laid up for us through all of our tribulation.</p>

<p>Oh, Bride of Jesus Christ, how happy I am to be One Of Them with each of you. What joy fills my heart to know He has given us a Revelation of His Word. When He tells us it will be so close it would deceive the very elected if it was possible, He has given us the TRUE REVELATION.</p>

<p>Come, get into the Spirit with us this Sunday at 12:00 P.M., Jeffersonville time, as we hear the perfect Word:  <em>60-1206 — The Smyrnaean Church Age</em>.</p>

                                    <p>Dear True Bride,</p>

<p>What a wonderful time we are having as His Life is flowing and pulsating in and through us, giving us life. Without Him, there would be no life. His Word is our very breath.</p>

<p>In this gross day of darkness, we are His last-age group that has risen up; His true Bride of the last day that will only listen to the Spirit, the Voice of God for our day.</p>

<p>How we love to hear Him tell us, “To Me, you are liken to pure beaten gold. Your righteousness is My righteousness. Your attributes are My glorious attributes. You are My lovely True Bride.”</p>

<p>As our battles seem to get harder and harder each week, we simply Press Play to hear Him speak to us so sweetly and tell us, “Don’t worry, you are worthy of My Gospel. You are a thing of beauty and joy. I love to watch you as you overcome the enemy by your trials and testing of this life.”</p>

<p>I see your labor of love; it is the high calling of your life to serve Me. I knew before the foundation of the world that you would recognize My mighty angel whom I would send to be My Voice to you; how you would not be deceived when the grievous wolves come around trying to claim equal revelation. You would not deviate from My Word, not for a moment, NOT BY ONE IOTA. You would stay with My Word, My Voice.</p>

<p>You would perceive as I reveal My Word to you how the True Vine and the false vine that started in the Garden of Eden would grow together throughout the ages.</p>

<p>What started in the early church would continue throughout every age. How in the first church age, Satan’s false vine would begin to creep into, and conquer the laity by his nicolaitane spirit. But how I love that <strong>only you</strong>, My elected Bride, will not be deceived.</p>

<p>This week, I will crystalize My Word in you by revealing the great mystery of the serpent’s seed. I will reveal to you in every detail what took place in the garden of Eden; how Satan got mixed into the human race.</p>

<p>It will be such a thrilling thought when you recognize that I, the Tree of Life in the Garden of Eden, which could not be approached until now because of the fall of Adam, is now given to you, My overcomers.</p>

<p>This will be your reward. I will give you the privilege of the paradise of God; a constant fellowship with Me. You will never be separated from Me. Whither I go, you, My Bride will go. What is Mine, I will share with you, My beloved.</p>

<p>How our hearts race within us as we read these words. We know the fulfillment of His promises are quickly approaching, and can hardly wait. May we hasten to obey His Word and thereby prove our worthiness to share His glory.</p>

<p>I’d like to beckon you to come join us as we continue our great study of the Seven Church Ages, where God is revealing His Word to us by His provided way, His seventh angel messenger.</p>

                                    <p>Dear Perfect Word Bride,</p>

<p>What is taking place within the Bride around the world? We’re getting in the Spirit, raising up and hollering, “Glory! Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!” God is transporting us and revealing His Word to His Bride.</p>

<p>The things we have read and heard all of our lives are now becoming manifested. A great quickening is taking place. We’re being illuminated by the Word like never before.</p>

<p>We feel it in the very depths of our souls. Something is different, something is taking place. We feel the Holy Spirit anointing us, filling our hearts and minds with His Word.</p>

<p>We can hear Him speaking to us: I know the enemy is battling you as never before, but don’t fear little ones, YOU’RE MINE. I give you My love, courage and ability. Just speak the Word, and I will perform it. I am with you always.</p>

<p>In our great study of the Revelation of Jesus Christ, we are under great anticipation each week what He is going to reveal to us next. His Word is our only refuge, peace and comfort. We listen intently over and over and over. Each paragraph we read, we want to scream and shout as the Word unfolds before our eyes. Rapturing Faith is coming upon the Bride, filling our souls.</p>

<p>Imagine, there is no other place in the world you can go, but right at your fingertips, to hear the Voice of God speak to you and reveal His Word.</p>

<p>How God took the veil away, pulled it back, and let John look in and see what each church age was going to do, and wrote It in a Book and sent It to us. Then, when the fullness of time come, God sent us His mighty seventh angel to speak It, and reveal what It all meant.</p>

<p>John wrote what he saw, but didn’t know its meaning. Jesus didn’t even know it when He was here on earth. No one throughout all the ages knew, until this day, this time, this people, US, His Bride.</p>

<p>How He has revealed to us that those seven lamps were drawing life and light from the resources of that main bowl. He told us how each one had their wicks dipped therein. Each church age messenger was on fire with the Holy Ghost with his wick immersed in Christ, drawing the very life of Christ and giving out that Light to the church. And now, our last day messenger, the greatest of all messengers, had the same life and the same Light manifested by a life that was hid with Christ in God.</p>

<p>Then our mighty angel tells us that not only was each messenger depicted there, BUT EACH ONE OF US ARE ALSO, <u>God’s true believers</u>. Each of us are also dramatically represented there. Each one of us are drawing from the same source as the messengers. We have all been dipped into the same bowl. We are dead to ourselves and OUR lives are hid with, and in, Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>

<p>How he encourages us by saying no man can pluck us out of God’s Hand. Our lives cannot be tampered with. Our visible life is burning and shining, giving light and manifestations of the Holy Ghost. Our inner, invisible life is hidden in God and fed by the Lord’s Word.</p>

<p>The battles are fierce. The enemy is raging like never before, trying his best to discourage us, beat us down, but he cannot do it.  God Himself speaks to us through human lips and tells us, WE ARE HIS BRIDE, WHOM HE CHOSE, and It defeats the devil EVERYTIME.</p>

<p>Our Perfect Lord, speaking His Perfect Word, giving Perfect Peace, to His Perfect Bride.</p>

<p>As always, we invite the world to come dip their wick into the MAIN BOWL, this Message, that has been stored up and preserved for the Bride. We will be screaming and shouting at 12:00 P.M., Jeffersonville time, as we hear the Voice of God speak and reveal what happened in: <em>The Patmos Vision 60-1204E</em>.</p>
